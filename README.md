## Description

The Library Manager API is a project developed using .NET 8 as part of the Mentoring .Net Expert course led by Luis Felipe. The primary goal of this project is to practice various software development concepts and best practices.

## The project will be divided into six parts:

- **REST API**: Implementing the core API endpoints for managing library resources while adhering to clean code principles.
- **Entity Framework**: Integrating Entity Framework for data access and management.
- **Clean Architecture**: Applying clean architecture principles to structure the application.
- **CQRS Pattern**: Implementing the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern for better separation of concerns.
- **Repository Pattern**: Using the Repository pattern for abstracting data access.
- **API Validation**: Ensuring robust validation for API inputs and operations.
In the initial phase, the focus will be on creating a basic project skeleton without database management or clean architecture. Subsequent steps of the course will involve implementing these additional features and enhancements.
